# Economy-and-Population-Growth

This research project is being carried out by Geroge Kontos, an Honours Student of the Honours Programme Bachelor of TU Delft. 

## Project Description

Over the history of mankind, the population and the economy of the entire world and each area specifically is constantly changing, due to natural causes like volcano eruptions or historical events such as colonization, war or the industrial revolution. Currently, the world population is vastly growing and is projected to reach numbers never seen before. As a natural result, a lot of cities are expected to become overpopulated, while currently, underpopulated areas might also increase in population significantly. This project aims to investigate what influence the population change has had on the economies of areas in the past and vice versa, and what happens to the population of an area when the economy changes. Furthermore, using these findings and an estimation of the evolution of the worldâ€™s population this project also aims to project what will happen to the economy of the areas that would see the most significant increase and decrease in population over the next years.

### Gibbs Sampler

The `GibbsSampler` directory contains a Python implementation of the Gibbs Sampler described by Ulrich K. Muller, James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson in their work **An Econometric Model of International Growth Dynamics for Long-horizon Forecasting**. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to estimate the distribution of specific parameters of the cross-country linear econometric model they describe.
